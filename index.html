                As of the 2021 Census, over <b>5.5 million</b> people held a bachelor's degree, a 31% rise since 2016, with Business and Management 
                being the most common fields. More than <b>3.6 million</b> students were in primary or secondary school, <b>1.2 million</b> in university, 
                and <b>600,000</b> in vocational training. These figures have continued to grow, highlighting education's increasing importance.
                <br><br>
                These numbers help analyse education trends. Identifying fields with lower enrolments or qualification gaps enables informed decisions, 
                resource allocation, and policies to address workforce shortages.

                Overall, <b>New South Wales is home to nearly one-third</b> of all qualification holders in Australia, making it a significant contributor to the 
                nation's educational landscape. 
                In contrast, the <b>Northern Territory has the lowest percentage</b> of qualification holders, with less than 1% of the total. This figure is
                indicative of its relatively smaller population compared to the other states and territories in Australia.

                In Australia, the <b>most common qualifications</b> are <b>Certificates</b> and <b>Bachelor's Degrees</b>, held by <b>34.8%</b> and <b>31.7%</b> of qualification holders, 
                respectively, highlighting their accessibility and popularity among individuals. In contrast, <b>Graduate Diplomas</b> and <b>Postgraduate Degrees</b> 
                are the least common qualifications, indicating that their higher levels of commitment, time, and financial investment may deter wider 
                participation.

                On average, <b>most qualifications</b> are <b>predominantly held by individuals born in Australia</b>, covering all qualification levels listed  
                except postgraduate degrees. In contrast, nearly <b>60% of postgraduate degrees are held by citizens born overseas</b>. This could 
                be due to the increasing number of international students pursuing advanced studies in Australia, as well as skilled individuals 
                seeking further qualifications to enhance their career prospects.

                the <b>overall count</b> of <b>primary schools exceeds</b> that of <b>secondary schools</b> across all categories, reflecting the government's strategy to

                Certain fields of study display a balanced representation of males and females, while others exhibit notable gender disparities. 
                For example, <b>"Creative Arts"</b> and <b>"Management and Commerce"</b> demonstrate a <b>similar gender distribution</b>, with Management and Commerce 
                recognized as the most commonly held degree in Australia, followed closely by Engineering.
                <br><br>
                In contrast, <b>females are predominantly represented</b> in degrees such as <b>Education, Society and Culture, and Health</b>, while <b>males are 
                more prevalent</b> in fields like <b>Architecture, Building, Engineering, and Information Technology</b>, highlighting the traditional roles 
                associated with these disciplines.
                <br><br>
                Overall, <b>Agriculture and Environmental Studies</b> emerge as the <b>least commonly held degrees</b>, closely followed by <b>Information Technology</b>.

                Overall, <b>Bachelor's Degrees</b> and <b>Certificates</b> emerge as the <b>most prevalent qualifications</b> across <b>nearly all income groups</b>, with the 
                exception of those earning "$156,000 or more." This trend aligns with previous findings that indicate these qualifications are the most 
                commonly pursued by individuals.
                <br><br>
                Interestingly, the <b>first two income groups</b> display the <b>same order of qualification distribution</b>, with certificates being the most common, 
                followed by bachelor's degrees, diplomas, postgraduate degrees, and graduate diplomas. However, in the <b>higher income</b> groups, <b>postgraduate degrees</b>
                 become far more <b>prevalent</b>, ranking in the top two or three, rather than fourth as in the lower groups. Diplomas and graduate diplomas, on the 
                 other hand, consistently remain the least represented across all income levels.
                <br><br>
                Moreover, the income group of <b>"$41,600 to $90,999"</b> contains the <b>highest number of individuals</b>, illustrating that a significant portion of the 
                Australian population falls within this range.
