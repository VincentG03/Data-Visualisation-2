                As of the 2021 Australian Census, over <b>5.5 million</b> people held a bachelor's degree, a 31% increase since 2016, with the most common 
                degrees in the fields of Business and Management. Just over <b>3.6 million</b> students were attending primary or secondary school, 
                with <b>1.2 million</b> students enrolled in university and <b>600,000</b> participating in vocational training. Since the census, these numbers
                 have shown consistent growth, highlighting the increasing value placed on education.

                Understanding these figures <b>offers a foundation to analyse trends</b> and patterns across various sectors of education. By identifying 
                fields with lower enrolments or emerging gaps in specific qualifications, stakeholders can make <b>informed decisions to improve 
                educational outcomes</b>. This may involve targeting specific degrees or training programmes that are underrepresented, allocating 
                more resources to these areas, or developing policies aimed at addressing workforce shortages.

                On average, most qualifications are predominantly held by individuals born in Australia, covering all qualification levels listed  
                except postgraduate degrees. In contrast, nearly 60% of postgraduate degrees are held by citizens born overseas. This could 
                be due to the increasing number of international students pursuing advanced studies in Australia, as well as skilled individuals 
                seeking further qualifications to enhance their career prospects.
