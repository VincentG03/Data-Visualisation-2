                As of the 2021 Australian Census, over <b>5.5 million</b> people held a bachelor's degree, a 31% increase since 2016, with the most common 
                degrees in the fields of Business and Management. Just over <b>3.6 million</b> students were attending primary or secondary school, 
                with <b>1.2 million</b> students enrolled in university and <b>600,000</b> participating in vocational training. Since the census, these numbers
                 have shown consistent growth, highlighting the increasing value placed on education.
                 <br><br>
                 Understanding these figures <b>offers a foundation to analyse trends</b> and patterns across various sectors of education. By identifying 
                 fields with lower enrolments or emerging gaps in specific qualifications, stakeholders can make <b>informed decisions to improve 
                 educational outcomes</b>. This may involve targeting specific degrees or training programmes that are underrepresented, allocating 
                 more resources to these areas, or developing policies aimed at addressing workforce shortages.

                On average, most qualifications are predominantly held by individuals born in Australia, covering all qualification levels listed  
                except postgraduate degrees. In contrast, nearly 60% of postgraduate degrees are held by citizens born overseas. This could 
                be due to the increasing number of international students pursuing advanced studies in Australia, as well as skilled individuals 
                seeking further qualifications to enhance their career prospects.

                Government schools outnumber both Catholic and other non-government schools, with more than double the number of secondary schools 
                and over triple the number of primary schools compared to Catholic schools, which have the second-most in both categories. Additionally, 
                the overall count of primary schools exceeds that of secondary schools across all categories, reflecting the government's strategy to 
                establish more primary schools.

                Certain fields of study display a balanced representation of males and females, while others exhibit notable gender disparities. 
                For example, "Creative Arts" and "Management and Commerce" demonstrate a similar gender distribution, with Management and Commerce 
                recognized as the most commonly held degree in Australia, followed closely by Engineering.
                <br><br>
                In contrast, females are predominantly represented in degrees such as Education, Society and Culture, and Health, while males are 
                more prevalent in fields like Architecture, Building, Engineering, and Information Technology, highlighting the traditional roles 
                associated with these disciplines.
                <br><br>
                Overall, Agriculture and Environmental Studies emerge as the least commonly held degrees, closely followed by Information Technology.

                In Australia, the most common qualifications are certificates and bachelor's degrees, held by 34.8% and 31.7% of qualification holders, 
                respectively, highlighting their accessibility and popularity among individuals. In contrast, Graduate Diplomas and Postgraduate Degrees 
                are the least common qualifications, indicating that their higher levels of commitment, time, and financial investment may deter wider 
                participation.
